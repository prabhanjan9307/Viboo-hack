# CampusConnect

## Overview
CampusConnect is a role-based platform built during a Vibe Coding hackathon.
It connects Students, Campus Authorities, and Service Partners to improve
campus services using verified demands and reviews.

## Problem
Students face poor or missing services on campus.
Colleges lack structured demand data.
Service Partners don’t know where real demand exists.

## Solution
CampusConnect brings all three stakeholders onto one platform
to enable data-driven campus service improvements.
