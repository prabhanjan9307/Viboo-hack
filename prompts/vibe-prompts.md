## Vibe Coding Prompt Strategy

We followed an iterative prompt-based development approach.

### Phase 1: System Design
Prompt focused on:
- Role separation (Students, Campus Authority, Service Partners)
- Trust and review moderation logic

### Phase 2: Feature Development
Separate prompts for:
- Student demand & review system
- Campus Authority dashboard
- Service Partner onboarding

### Phase 3: Refinement
Prompts used to:
- Simplify UI
- Improve naming
- Reduce overengineering

AI was used as a co-developer, while final decisions were made by the team.

## Sample Prompts Used

### Prompt 1: System Architecture
"Design a role-based web platform with Students, Campus Authority, and Service Partners.
Focus on trust, review moderation, and scalable structure for a campus service system."

### Prompt 2: Student Demand & Review Flow
"Create logic where students can post service demands, upvote them, and review existing services.
Prevent fake or joke reviews using reporting and aggregation."

### Prompt 3: Service Partner Flow
"Design a vendor onboarding flow where service partners can browse college demands and apply to serve a campus."

These prompts were iteratively refined during development.
